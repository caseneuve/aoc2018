This blog is my personal "journal" where I keep notes about solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles and learning [Clojure](https://clojure.org/). It by no means pretend to be a tutorial for anyone. While I try to find idiomatic solutions which respect the language design I don't claim solutions provided here are canonical (BTW if you find misunderstandings, syntax abuse or other errors, please let me know!).

This being said I hope my notes might be useful for those who share my [idea](https://pkaznowski.gitlab.io/aoc18/idea) of learning a new lang.
