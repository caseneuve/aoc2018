## Why Clojure? {#why-clojure}

I've been attracted to functional programming ever since I've became aware of the idea. This attraction may be affiliated with my love for Lisp. This story has yet to be told but my adventure with coding started with Emacs[^fn:1], that is with Elisp langwise, and -- as we put it in Polish -- "first love does not rust" (old love never dies), nor does my inclination to Lisp(y)s.

Working in a Lisp environment is one of my professional dreams and Clojure provides the opportunity.

But for now the most important thing is (I write this after having solved some puzzles already) -- writing programs in Clojure is so rewarding and fun I don't want to stop doing this!


## Learn the Hard Way with AoC {#learn-the-hard-way-with-aoc}

I love not only Lisps but learning languages in general (be it Latin, Greek, C or Python). When it comes to programming languages I found I'm neither "read-the-docs-and-forget" nor "type-mechanically-examples-from-30h-bootcamp" person. I tried many approaches but solving real problems or writing real apps is the best way to effectively learn, at least for me.

I heard about [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) before but 2019 edition was the first I participated in. Since I'm not experienced competitive programmer (yet?) I managed to [finish all puzzles](https://gitlab.com/pkaznowski/advent%5Fof%5Fcode%5F2019) during Christmas holidays. I found the idea not only entertaining but also very useful in terms of upgrading coding skills.

Then I realized it could be a great tool to learn a new language -- every puzzle requires writing a small program involving using of different design approaches, data structures and algorithms; puzzles are finite and concrete. From very easy to hard. And, last but not least, there is a [great community](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) eager to help and lots of solutions to compare to. There is fun in solving a puzzle but also satisfaction in discovering there are _better solutions_ than mine so I can still improve my style.


## Methodology {#methodology}

My approach is simple. I'll try to do every puzzle by:

1.  designing an abstract solution
2.  looking for appropriate Clojure tools to implement this.

Since I'm doing 2018 edition, competitive aspect is not important and solving everything without any hints is not my priority. If I'd ever be stuck I'll look for solutions and then try to implement them the Clojurian way. When my solution is ready and working I will compare it to other Clojure solutions out there, refactor and keep some notes about what I've learned.
