# Advent of Code 2018
My personal solutions in Clojure.

Please visit my [AoC 2018 blog] for better reading experience.

All puzzles, solutions and additional notes are stored in an Org-mode file
[aoc2018.org].

[Only up to day 7]

## Edit 2022

As I revisited AoC 2018 few years later to finish what I've started, solutions from
7b up, are organised differently.  They can be found in [Clojure](Clojure/)
directory, and bootstrapping each day / solving the puzzle can be done using `bb`
tasks (see: `bb tasks`).
